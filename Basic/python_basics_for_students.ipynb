    "# Python Basics for Class 8/10 Students\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains **Conditional Operations**, **Logical Operations**, **Range Function**, and **Loops** in Python in a simple way. These are important concepts for programming, and we'll break them down with examples!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Conditional Operations (if-else statements)\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional operations help your program make decisions. They work with **Boolean values** (`True` or `False`) and use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to check conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Will I go to school?\n",
    "Imagine it's raining, and you decide whether to go to school based on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "rain = False\n",
    "if rain == True:\n",
    "    print(\"I won't go to school.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"I will go to school.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**: \n",
    "- If `rain` is `True`, it prints \"I won't go to school.\"\n",
    "- If `rain` is `False`, it prints \"I will go to school.\"\n",
    "- Since `rain = False`, the output is: **I will go to school.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Can I get a license?\n",
    "You can only get a license if you're 18 or older.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 17\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You can get a license.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are under 18.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- If `age` is 18 or more, it prints \"You can get a license.\"\n",
    "- If `age` is less than 18, it prints \"You are under 18.\"\n",
    "- Since `age = 17`, the output is: **You are under 18.**\n"

    "## 2. Logical Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operations combine conditions using **and**, **or**, and **not**. They also work with `True` and `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AND Operation\n",
    "- Returns `True` only if **both conditions** are `True`.\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - `True and True` = `True`\n",
    "  - `True and False` = `False`\n",
    "  - `False and True` = `False`\n",
    "  - `False and False` = `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "### OR Operation\n",
    "- Returns `True` if **at least one condition** is `True`.\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - `True or True` = `True`\n",
    "  - `True or False` = `True`\n",
    "  - `False or True` = `True`\n",
    "  - `False or False` = `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "### NOT Operation\n",
    "- Reverses the value.\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - `not True` = `False`\n",
    "  - `not False` = `True`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3: Candy Box Rewards\n",
    "Based on your exam marks, you get candy boxes!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "marks = 85\n",
    "if marks >= 90 and marks <= 100:\n",
    "    print(\"You get two candy boxes!\")\n",
    "elif marks >= 80 and marks <= 89:\n",
    "    print(\"You get one candy box!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You get nothing.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- If marks are between 90 and 100 (both conditions true), you get two candy boxes.\n",
    "- If marks are between 80 and 89, you get one candy box.\n",
    "- Otherwise, you get nothing.\n",
    "- Since `marks = 85`, the output is: **You get one candy box!**\n"

    "## 3. Range Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range()` function creates a sequence of numbers. You can turn it into a list using `list()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax: `range(start, end, step)`\n",
    "- **start**: Starting number (included).\n",
    "- **end**: Ending number (not included).\n",
    "- **step**: How much to increase or decrease by (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Basic range\n",
    "a = list(range(10))\n",
    "print(a)  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Range with start and end\n",
    "b = list(range(4, 10))\n",
    "print(b)  # Output: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Range with step\n",
    "c = list(range(0, 10, 2))\n",
    "print(c)  # Output: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Descending range\n",
    "d = list(range(10, 0, -1))\n",
    "print(d)  # Output: [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- `range(10)` gives numbers from 0 to 9.\n",
    "- `range(4, 10)` gives numbers from 4 to 9.\n",
    "- `range(0, 10, 2)` gives even numbers from 0 to 8.\n",
    "- `range(10, 0, -1)` gives numbers from 10 down to 1.\n"

    "## 4. Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops let you repeat tasks. Python has two main types: **for loops** and **while loops**. We'll focus on **for loops** here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Loop\n",
    "A `for` loop repeats something for each item in a sequence (like a list, string, or range).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 4: Printing with a For Loop\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    print(i, \"Nabil\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- Loops through numbers 0 to 9 and prints each number with \"Nabil\".\n",
    "- Output:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  0 Nabil\n",
    "  1 Nabil\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "  9 Nabil\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 5: Looping Through a String\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = \"Hi, I am Nabil\"\n",
    "for letter in s:\n",
    "    print(letter)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- Loops through each character in the string and prints it.\n",
    "- Output: One letter per line (H, i, ,, I, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 6: Looping Through a List\n",
    "```python\n",
    "l = [\"potato\", \"fish\", 98, \"10 oranges\", 2.33, \"lemon\", 98969.24, 55, -120, \"go to market\", 10]\n",
    "for item in l:\n",
    "    print(item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- Prints each item in the list, one per line.\n",
    "- Output: potato, fish, 98, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 7: Filtering Numbers\n",
    "```python\n",
    "l2 = [25, 36, 21, 10, 35, 1, 2, 98, 5, 27, 21, 44, 11, 9, 17]\n",
    "for i in l2:\n",
    "    if i >= 30:\n",
    "        print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- Prints only numbers from the list that are 30 or greater.\n",
    "- Output: 36, 35, 98, 44.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 8: Numbers Divisible by 3 and 5\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(100):\n",
    "    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:\n",
    "        print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- Checks numbers from 0 to 99.\n",
    "- Prints numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 (like 0, 15, 30, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 9: Sum of Numbers\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sum = 0\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    sum = sum + i\n",
    "print(sum)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- Adds numbers from 0 to 9 (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + 9).\n",
    "- Output: **45**.\n",
    "- **Note**: To sum numbers from 1 to 10, use `range(1, 11)`.\n"
